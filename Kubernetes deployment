A Kubernetes Deployment is a resource object that manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods in a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that a specified number of replicas of an application are running and can automatically roll out updates.

Key Features of Kubernetes Deployment

Self-healing: Automatically replaces failed pods.

Scaling: Can scale up or down using kubectl scale.

Rolling Updates: Allows updating applications without downtime.

Rollback: Can revert to previous versions if needed.
